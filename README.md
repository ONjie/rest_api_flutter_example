## Working with REST APIs - Flutter

### How do APIs Work?
A user application can make GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE HTTP requests to a database. 
In return, the database sends us data, results, or responses in the form of JSON, 
HTML, or XML (with the JSON format being the most widely used). 
We then parse the JSON into a proper model class and use it in our app

### Integrating an API into your Flutter app

There are a few steps that you can follow to easily integrate an API into your Flutter app:

Step one: Get the API URL and endpoints, and create a constant file that stores URLs and endpoints .

Step two: Add relevant packages into the app (http).

Step three: Create a model class to parse the JSON.

Step four: Create a file that handles the API call, and write specific methods to fetch and parse data.

Step five: Use the data in your app.
